# ðŸª£ðŸ’£ s3-nuke ðŸ’£ðŸª£
Nuke all the files and all versions from an S3 Bucket rapidly by utilizing both concurrency and bulk API calls to AWS. 

### Features
  * By utilizing concurrency and bulk API calls, s3-nuke is fast at what it does!
  * Auto-detect S3 bucket region -- no need to figure out what region the bucket is in before hand!
  * Text-based UI makes it easy to select your target bucket!
  * S3-Nuke includes safety prompts to ensure you _REALLY_ want to nuke everything in a bucket! After all, the operation is not reversible  since you are removing all the object versions as well!
  * Includes extra tooling to give you a quick look at bucket metrics (`s3-metrics`) or generate test buckets with data (`s3-gen`)
### Why?
_...because deleting any bucket with files is just plain annoying._

There have been so many times when I've needed to delete a bucket, but AWS won't let you because the bucket isn't empty. Emptying the bucket isn't a trivial task when it has, for example, been in production for years and has millions of objects inside. Using the AWS console's "Empty Bucket" isn't an option because it's horribly slow and prone to failure. 

While there are several other scripts and projects that do the same function, I wanted something
with a little more interactivity. (Also, I was bored ðŸ˜Š)

### Required AWS policy

S3-Nuke requires S3 access to list {buckets, objects, versions}, delete {objects, versions}. Cloudwatch permissions are optional and used to retrieve extra information about the target bucket. 

```
  {
    .
    .
    .
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
          "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
          "s3:ListBucketVersions",
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
          "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
      ],
    .
    .
    .
  }
```

### s3-gen

This tool was created mainly for testing s3-nuke. This tool will generate `num-buckets` number of buckets, each containing `num-objects` number of objects (containing random data), with `num-versions` number of versions. If `num-versions` < 2, s3-gen will create the buckets with versioning disabled.

#### Installing s3-metrics binary

* using `go`:
```
go install github.com/soapiestwaffles/s3-nuke/tools/s3-gen@latest
```

#### Running s3-gen from source

```
go run tools/s3-gen/main.go --num-buckets=INT --num-objects=INT --num-versions=INT
```

#### Usage/Available flags

```
s3-nuke tool: generate a set of randomized buckets each containing a set of randomized objects and versions

Flags:
  -h, --help                     Show context-sensitive help.
  -e, --aws-endpoint=STRING      override AWS endpoint address ($AWS_ENDPOINT)
  -n, --num-buckets=INT          number of buckets with randomized names to create
  -o, --num-objects=INT          number of random objects generated and put into buckets
  -v, --num-versions=INT         number of versions to create for each random object
  -r, --region="us-west-2"       specify region to create bucket and objects in
  -p, --bucket-prefix="s3gen"    prefix for every bucket name generated
      --yes                      bypass user prompt and proceed with action automatically
```

#### Example output

```console
$ go run tools/s3-gen/main.go --num-buckets=3 --num-objects=1000 --num-versions=10 --region="us-west-2"
